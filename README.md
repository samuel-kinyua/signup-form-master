## Overview
This challenge involved creading a simple landing page with a signup form that allows users to signup for a free trail. it uses javascript to do the clientside validation of the form, css for styling and html5 as the markup language.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
I created the html and used various htmls elemsnts and used classes to group content togther to facilitate group styling in css as well as id's to make individual styles to specific elemnts using css. I used the css flexbox to create the layout of the webpage.then used javascript for dom manupulation that allowed me to have client side form validation.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
-javascrip


### What I learned
I learn DOM manupulation using javascript. also, I learn how to do the form validation on the client side using javascript as well as making responsive webpages that can be viewd on all devices by using flexbox an viewport.

### Continued development

am planning to continue developing projects that utilise dom manupalation as well as javascript form validation. again, I will continue to build projects with complex layout which will allow me to get better at css.

### Useful resources
